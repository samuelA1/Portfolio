      <p>I am a full stack developer with <strong>three years of experience.</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>I have developed, deployed and maintained multiple self made projects. Often develop both the front-end and back-end of these multiple projects.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am most confident, familiar and current with <strong>NodeJs, AngularJs, MongoDb, Express (MEAN STACK), jQuery, PHP, Laravel and all the other various frameworks, libraries and technologies related to them.</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>I also enjoy working with people and groups, as it gives me the ability to learn and teach more people all over the world.</p>

     <div>
        <h2> <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Front-end web development</h2>
        <p>I specialize in applications built in <strong>Angular</strong>, together with <strong>HTML5 and CSS3</strong></p>
        <p>I have built and maintained <strong>three single paged applications with Angular </strong></p>
        <p>
            My current experience and skills in front-end include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              lead TypeScript/JavaScript development: bootstraping or refactoring an existing app architecture, by improving its' extensibility and reliability;
            </li>
            <li>
              good sense of design and UX, by having some small past experience in graphic design
            </li>
            <li>
              knowledge and experience in JS ecosystem, by using many libraries like Angular, jQuery, Lodash/Underscore and whatever else was needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
     </div>
     <div>
       <h2><i class="fas fa-code"></i> Back-end web development</h2>
       <p>My current stack in back-end development includes <strong>NodeJs and Express, PHP and Laravel</strong></p>
       <p>
          Every app I have done has the back-end written completely me. In order to improve the development speed, performance and reliability, I have changed languages and frameworks from PHP to NodeJs which is now the fastest and most reliable sever-side v8 engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, my experience and lessons I learned while doing all those apps, will stay with me and be useful forever, no matter what framework I will use in the next project.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          What I can do is:
        </p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>
            build Restful APIs in NodeJs/PHP
          </li>
          <li>
            cooperation with APIs, remote data synchronizations, cloud servers, asynchronous workers
          </li>
          <li>
            using different types of databases like <strong>MYSQL(relational), NoSQL(non-relational), and MONGODB</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions and classes.
          </li>
        </ul>
